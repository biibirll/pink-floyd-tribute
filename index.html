			<p>Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first
				British
				psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical
				lyrics
				and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the
				greatest
				progressive rock band of all time.</p>
			<p>Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass
				guitar,
				vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles
				and the
				successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in
				December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist
				and
				thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon
				(1973),
				Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd –
				The Wall
				(1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.</p>
			<p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason
				continued as
				Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The
				Division Bell
				(1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a
				performance at the
				global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The
				Endless
				River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and
				Mason
				reformed Pink Floyd to release the song "Hey, Hey, Rise Up!" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.</p>
			<p>By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music
				artists
				of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these
				albums and
				Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard
				200,
				and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include "See Emily Play" (1967), "Money" (1973),
				"Another
				Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (1979), "Not Now John" (1983), "On the Turning Away" (1987) and "High Hopes" (1994).
				They
				were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008,
				Pink Floyd
				were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.</p>
